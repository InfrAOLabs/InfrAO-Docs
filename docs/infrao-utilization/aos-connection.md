# ðŸ”Œ Connecting via CLI to InfrAO-Deployed Processes

If a process was deployed using **InfrAO's Compute Unit (CU)** and **Memory Unit (MU)** infrastructure, you need to explicitly tell the `aos` CLI where to route the connection.

## ðŸ§­ Basic Command

```bash
aos InfrAO-Deployed-Process \
  --mu-url https://ur-mu.randao.net \
  --cu-url https://ur-cu.randao.net \
  --wallet pathToWallet.json
```

Replace:
- `InfrAO-Deployed-Process` with your target **Process ID**
- `pathToWallet.json` with your **local wallet path**

## ðŸ§  Why It Matters

InfrAO processes live on dedicated hardware that is separate from the default public cluster. Without specifying these `--mu-url` and `--cu-url` flags, your CLI won't be able to locate or interact with the process.

### âœ… Use this when:

- You're interacting with any process deployed via the [InfrAO Deployment Script](./deploying-on-su)
- You want to ensure **fast, reliable communication** via InfrAOâ€™s private infrastructure
